Problems with Specs:
====================

9.1.1 Normalize Request Parameters

# escapes out individual parameters. Spec says this should simply order and concatenate them. FIXED
# duplicate key names should be sorted by value FIXED in mojodna fork

9.1.2.  Construct Request URL

# Should normalize using scheme, host and path leaving out other uri parameters. Scheme and host should be lowercase. FIXED
