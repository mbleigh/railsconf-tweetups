TwitterAuth Generator
=====================

The TwitterAuth generator allows you to generate the components necessary to implement Twitter as a Single Sign-On provider for your site.

To run it, you simply need to call it:

script/generate twitter_auth

This will generate the migration necessary for the users table as well as generate a User model that extends the appropriate TwitterAuth model template and a config/twitter.yml that allows you to set your OAuth consumer key and secret. 

By default, TwitterAuth uses OAuth as its authentication strategy. If you wish to use HTTP Basic you can pass in the --basic option.
